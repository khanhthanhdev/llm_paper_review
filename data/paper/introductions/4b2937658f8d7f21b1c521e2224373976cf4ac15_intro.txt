Sign language has been developed for a long time and is recognized as the official language of the deaf community in various countries. The sign language used by the deaf community in Vietnam is called Vietnamese sign language (VSL). Although sign language has many similarities with spoken language, there are significant differences between sign language and spoken/written language [1]. For example, in American sign language (ASL), there is a separate grammar system (separate rules for phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics) that differs from English [2]. Similarly, VSL is used as the official language in the deaf community of Vietnam with about 7 million people. Like other foreign languages, the communication barrier is significant if one cannot understand and interpret sign language.

The sign language interpretation process involves two tasks, which are translating from sign language to spoken language and vice versa. Among them, the translation task from spoken language is an important task to convey information and provide social knowledge to the deaf.

The process of translating spoken language into sign language involves the following steps.

In which, (1) refers to the process of translating speech recognition into text. Many studies and applications have effectively handled this task, such as Googleâ€™s API. (2) is the process of processing ordinary text into correct syntax in sign language. (3) is the process of simulating correctly syntaxed sign language text into representations such as 3D models, videos, or images of sign language.

In this procedure, the second step gets the most attention due to the completion of the conveyed message. The basic challenge is that sign language, in general, has a limited vocabulary compared to spoken/written language. If the machine translation is poorly performed, the complete message might not be successfully communicated, or in some cases, the conveyed message has a different meaning from the original [3].

The VSL translation task involves taking a regular Vietnamese sentence as input and producing an image, video, or 3D model as the final output. However, an important intermediate step in the translation process is to convert the regular Vietnamese sentence to a syntactically correct sentence in VSL. This is because VSL has some basic features such as reductionism, emphasis on focal points, and changes in word order compared to regular Vietnamese. In addition, there have been proposed technical methods for representing syntactically correct VSL sentences as images or 3D models that have produced good results. This means that the components of the sentence are separated, and we store them in a dictionary as a code that contains two components: the word/phrase and how it is represented using a 3D model. The soft-linkage motion between the sentence components is handled using interpolation techniques. Therefore, the scope of the task is focused on translating regular Vietnamese sentences into syntactically correct sign language sentences.

With remarkable advances in information technology, there have been the sign language translation systems developed worldwide, such as TESSA, which translates speech into British sign language (BSL) [4]; ViSiCAST, a tool for translating English into British sign language [5]; SignSynth project that employs the ASCII-Stokoe model [6]; ASL Workbench, an automated text-to-American sign language translation system [7]; and TEAM project, a system that translates text into American sign language using a contiguous bilingual parse tree technique [8]. Most of these research projects initially relied on structural-based translation models.

Recent studies have been maximizing the use of advances in natural language processing (NLP), deep neural networks (DNN), and machine translation (MT) to develop systems that can translate between sign language and spoken language, to bridge the communication gap between the sign language community and the spoken language community [9]. A recent study of Gouri Sankar Mishra and colleagues proposed a system for translating spoken English into Indian sign language (ISL)[10]. The translation model follows a rule-based approach in which a parser is used to parse the full English sentence into a dependency structure representing the syntax and grammar information of a sentence. An ISL sentence is then generated from an ISL bilingual dictionary and a word network, with the ISL cues corresponding to the appropriate ISL signs being displayed.

Galian et al. experimented with two NMT architectures with optimized hyperparameters, various tokenization methods, and two data augmentation techniques (back-translation and paraphrasing). Through experimentation, they achieved significant improvements for models trained on the Phoenix 14T and DGS datasets for German sign language [11]. Following research on sign name adoption by Ka corri et al. [12], acceptance within the Deaf community is crucial for the application of sign language technologies. The perspective of Deaf users must be accurately analyzed, and the implementation of technology for the deaf community must be effective [13].

Currently, machine translation of Vietnamese sign language (VSL) is still a new and underexplored research field. Like other sign language translation problems in the world, many studies on VSL focus on the second step of the translation process - translating from regular text to the correct syntax in sign language. Therefore, there have been some studies on VSL related to the problem of translating Vietnamese to VSL with promising results, but there are also many limitations. The prominent limitation of these studies is the small database, which leads to low accuracy [14, 15, 8].

We have achieved certain results with the methods and translation models on a small dataset that we have constructed. Our research process has gone through several stages [16, 17]. Initially, we proposed a rule-based translation method based on the syntax rules of VSL. In this paper, we have experimented with some more advanced machine translation methods using a neural network approach and proposed a simple data enrichment method to apply to translation models. This is necessary for training models to help the translation system become more accurate. Section 3 presents the experimental results with some proposed modern translation models, and finally, a detailed analysis and evaluation results will be presented.
