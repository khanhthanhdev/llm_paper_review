The submission "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" is positioned within the realm of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), focusing on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for machine translation, specifically English to French translation using the WMT'14 dataset. The paper's novel contribution is the reversal of word order in source sentences to improve LSTM performance, a technique not commonly addressed in related works. While the authors claim a general end-to-end approach with minimal assumptions on sequence structure, this may be overstated as similar methods have been explored with deep LSTMs and attention mechanisms. The empirical improvements in BLEU scores should be critically evaluated to determine if they stem from conceptual advances or implementation details. The submission's novelty is primarily in the word order reversal, while its general approach aligns with existing trends in enhancing RNN architectures.
